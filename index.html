  <h2> About Me </h2>
  <p>After high school, I worked as a low voltage technician for a couple of years but ended up developing an interest in web development and software engineering.
    Now, as a student at Thinkful in the software engineering course, I could not be happier with my own progression as a web developer. I'm excited to work with other developers on web projects or even new software. 
    Outside of web development and software engineering, some other interests of mine include:

    <!-- Right here I used an unordered list to showcase some of my interests -->
      <ul>  
        <li>Going out to swim, whether that be at the beach, a creek, or watering holes.</li>
        <li>Go and find new food to try or restaurants to visit (I'm a huge foodie).</li>
      </ul>
